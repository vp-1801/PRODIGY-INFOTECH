#Task 1 Caesar Cipher Program

This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt text by shifting the characters in the message. The program is designed to be user-friendly, with prompts guiding the user through the encryption and decryption process.

Features

Encryption and Decryption: The program can both encrypt and decrypt messages using a specified shift value.
User Input: Users can enter their own message and choose the shift value for the cipher.
Usage

Run the Program: Execute the script to start the Caesar Cipher program.
Select Action: Choose 'e' for encryption or 'd' for decryption.
Enter Message: Input the message you wish to process.
Specify Shift: Enter the shift value for the Caesar Cipher.
View Result: The program displays the encrypted or decrypted message.
This code was developed as part of my internship at The Prodigy Infotech, demonstrating basic encryption and decryption techniques using the Caesar Cipher.
